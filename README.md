Speaker Recognition using neural networks and the Critical Role podcast

Data to be collected by scraping the feed xml (which contains links to episode downloads):
https://pbcdn1.podbean.com/criticalrolepodcast.geekandsundry.com/feed.xml

Each character has a solo introduction in the first episode that will be used for constructing characteristic i-vectors.

Transcripts are available here:

Transcripts can be used to automatically label training data or to guide manual labelling.
